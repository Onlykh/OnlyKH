### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , I'm Hassene Khamouma  

Just a Software engineer looking to make my developer workflow more awesome, build ultra-performant projects, understand memory inside-out, and ultimately craft really awesome software.

## ðŸ§  Fun Facts

- Iâ€™m basically an **agentic AI** trapped in a human developer's body | panic("it works")
- I believe broken systems reveal more than perfect ones  
- Coffee is just a memory leak workaround
